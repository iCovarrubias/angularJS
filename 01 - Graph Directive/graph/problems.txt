Problems found during development
   
1. The charts directive
	+ Loading with the google loader can be not so cool, it's bugged,
		in the ChartService.js we add a "callback" parameter to the load
		method to fix it, if the parameter is ommited, then DataTable is not loaded.

	+ Without knowing about the previous issue with google loader, it was hard
		to find a good place for the google.load method to live, see main.js

	+ Another possible solution was to load the google loader with the "?autoload" parameter,
		however, we can't relly on this one, it is possible that our directives load 
		faster than the google charts module, breaking our code.

	+ Clicking the RESET button doesn't really return to the original data, it actually assigns
	 a new object to the data, which is expected, to demonstrate how watchers behave.

2. The spreadsheets one
	+ I keep saying stylesheets instead of spreadsheets
	+ Finding one that didn't require google spreadsheets
	+ There are some libraries that implement this functionality but relly on google spreadsheets
	+ There's SpreadJS but it requires registration and it seems that's not free, so I didn't bother
	+ Updating the value in the scope (with a click) correctly udpdates the component;
		updating the value manually in the view affects the scope, however, bindings to 
		parts of the data array don't get updated (see directives/spreadsheet.js)
